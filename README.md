# Design history for GOV.UK services

A place for you to document your GOV.UK service designs.

<https://design-history.herokuapp.com>

## Purpose of this project

This repository makes it easy to:

* screenshot your designs
* create pages of screenshots to document designs
* document designs using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
* print pages of designs
* make designs shareable and linkable

## Installation and getting started
